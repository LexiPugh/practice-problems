## Introduction

Starting on December 1st 2023, I'm going to do one practice problem per day! My goal with this repository is to:
- Further my coding skills to land a data analyst position
- Build up my GitHub profile

I'll continue doing these practice problems at least until I land a job as a data analyst, and possibly even after that! The practice questions will come from a variety of sources, such as:
- [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com/) 
- [Analyst Builder](https://www.analystbuilder.com/) 
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql)

Some of the practice problems will be in SQL, some will be in Python, and some will be in both. Thank you for taking the time to view my practice problems repository :D
