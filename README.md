# **Welcome to my SQL Practice Repository!**

Starting on 11/30/2023, I'm going to do one SQL exercise per day! My goal with this repository is to:
- Further my SQL skills to land a data analyst position
- Build up my GitHub profile

I'll continue doing these practice problems at least until I land a job as a data analyst, and possibly even after that! The practice questions will come from a variety of sources, such as:
- [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com/) 
- [Analyst Builder](https://www.analystbuilder.com/) 

I'll always specify where I got the question from. Thank you for viewing my SQL practice repository :D
