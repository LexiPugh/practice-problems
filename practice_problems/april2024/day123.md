## The Question

Twitter (now known as "X"), is known for being addicting. Scrolling and Tweeting (or "X-ing"?) has become synonymous with social media.

Find the average time (in minutes) that each user waits until their next Tweet.

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT
  twitter_id,
  AVG(time_difference) AS avg_time_diff
FROM (
  SELECT 
    twitter_id,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, LAG(tweet_time) OVER(PARTITION BY twitter_id ORDER BY tweet_time), tweet_time) AS time_difference
  FROM 
    twitter_addiction) AS tweet_time_table
GROUP BY
  twitter_id
```

Output Table:

| twitter_id | avg_time_diff |
| :--------- | :------------ |
| 1001       | 240           |
| 1002       | 435           |
| 1003       | 22.5          |
