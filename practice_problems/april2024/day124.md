## The Question

You are given a list of user email addresses, and you need to extract the domain name from each email address.

The domain in alex@gmail.com would be "gmail".

Write a query to extract the domain name from each email address and count the number of occurrences of each domain name in the list.

The results should be sorted by the count of occurrences. Also sort by domains in descending order.

emails Table:

| Field         | Data Type |
| :------------ | :-------- |
| email_address | text      |

emails Input:

| email_address                   |
| :------------------------------ |
| john@yahoo.com                  |
| jane.doe@gmail.com              |
| bob.smith@gmail.com             |
| alice@aol.com                   |
| charlie.brown@yahoo.com         |

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT
  domain,
  COUNT(domain) AS domain_count
FROM (
  SELECT 
    SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(email_address, "@", -1), '.', 1) AS domain
  FROM 
    emails ) AS temp_table
GROUP BY
  domain
ORDER BY
  domain_count DESC,
  domain DESC
```

Output Table:

| domain         | domain_count |
| :------------- | :----------- |
| gmail          | 3            |
| yahoo          | 2            |
| aol            | 1            |
