# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT
  customer_id
FROM (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    DATEDIFF(visit_date, LAG(visit_date) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY customer_id ASC, visit_date ASC)) AS days_between_purchase
  FROM 
    customers ) AS difference_table
WHERE
  days_between_purchase <= 5
GROUP BY
  customer_id
```

Output Table:

| customer_id |
| :---------- |
| 1001        |
| 1004        |
| 1005        |
