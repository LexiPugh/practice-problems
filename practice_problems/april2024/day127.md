## The Question

Facebook tracks every action a user makes (like, post, comment, etc.) on their platform.

Write a query to determine the Rank of each action performed on Christmas Day (12/25)

The output should include the action performed, number of actions, and their rank. If two actions were performed equally, they should have the same rank. The next rank should skip to the correct number in the sequence, not numerically.

Order on the rank from smallest to largest and actions alphabetically.

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT 
  actions,
  COUNT(actions) AS action_count,
  RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(actions) DESC) AS rank_num
FROM 
  facebook
WHERE
  dates = '2023-12-25'
GROUP BY
  actions
ORDER BY
  rank_num ASC,
  actions ASC
```

Output Table:

| actions | action_count | rank_num |
| :------ | :----------- | :------- |
| Comment | 13           | 1        |
| Like    | 13           | 1        |
| Post    | 11           | 3        |
| Share   | 6            | 4        |
| Report  | 2            | 5        |
