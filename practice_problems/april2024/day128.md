## The Question

Here we have the names of several students first and last names.

We need all of the names to be in Proper Case. This is where the first character is capitalized and all the other letters are lower case.

Please include the first name and last name combined into one column in proper case. Proper case should be applied to both first and last name.

For example: "JOHN MATSON -> John Matson"

Order by the first and last name in alphabetical order.

<br>

names Table:

| Field      | Data Type |
| :--------- | :-------- |
| first_name | text      |
| last_name  | text      |

names Input:

| first_name | last_name |
| :--------- | :-------- |
| JAMES      | JIMOTHY   |
| Johnny     | Slides    |
| sally      | smalls    |
| ALleN      | LisBiTs   |
| HairY      | StyLes    |
| KEVIN      | BACON     |

<br>

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT 
  CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(first_name, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(first_name, 2)), " ",
  UPPER(LEFT(last_name, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(last_name, 2))) AS full_name
FROM 
  names
ORDER BY
  full_name ASC
