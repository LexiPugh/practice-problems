# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT
  p.product_id,
  p.price
FROM (
  SELECT
    product_id,
    MAX(dates) AS max_date
  FROM
    price_check
  WHERE 
    dates <= '2022-04-07'
  GROUP BY
    product_id ) AS m
  JOIN price_check AS p 
  ON p.product_id = m.product_id
  AND p.dates = m.max_date
ORDER BY
  product_id
```

Output Table:
