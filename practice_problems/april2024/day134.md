# My Solution

``` SQL
WITH consecutive_visits AS (
  SELECT 
      n.id,
      name,
      visit_date,
      DATEDIFF(d.visit_date, LAG(visit_date) OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY visit_date ASC)) AS days_between_visits
    FROM 
      names AS n INNER JOIN dates AS d
      ON n.id = d.id
)
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  MAX(num_consecutive_visits) AS max_consecutive_visits
FROM (
  SELECT
    *,
    SUM(CASE WHEN days_between_visits = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + 1 AS num_consecutive_visits
  FROM 
    consecutive_visits
  GROUP BY
    id ) AS final_consecutive_visits
```

Output Table:

| id | name | max_consecutive_visits |
| :- | :--- | :--------------------- |
| 1  | Ron  | 4                      |
