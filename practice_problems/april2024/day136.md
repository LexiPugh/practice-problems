## The Question

A NASCAR team has collected data on their racer's laps for the entire 250 lap race.

The Team wants to look at the slowest 3 lap times and fastest 3 lap times.

They want the 3 distinct slowest and fastest times. For example: if the times were 45,45,45,46,47,48. The 3 slowest times would be 45,46,47. These should be given the label "Slowest" and a rank for each.

Output should include the label, time, and it's ranking.

Order on Label Descending and Rankings Ascending.

# My Solution

``` SQL
WITH joined_data AS (
  SELECT 
    o.total_amount,
    c.customer_name,
    MONTH(order_date) AS month
  FROM 
    orders AS o INNER JOIN customers AS c
    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
)
SELECT
  month,
  customer_name,
  monthly_total_spending
FROM (
  SELECT
    *,
    SUM(total_amount) AS monthly_total_spending,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY month ORDER BY total_amount DESC) AS row_num
  FROM
    joined_data
  GROUP BY 
    month,
    customer_name ) AS spending_table
WHERE
  row_num = 1
ORDER BY
  month ASC
```

Output Table:

| month | customer_name | monthly_total_spending |
| :---- | :------------ | :--------------------- |
| 1     | Jane Doe      | 2000                   |
| 2     | Bob Johnson   | 3000                   |
| 3     | John Smith    | 18000                  |
