## The Question

You are given a database containing customer addresses.

Write a query to break out the address column into separate columns for street, city, state, and postal_code.

Note: Some addresses may have additional unit or suite information (e.g., "Suite 5A" or "Unit B"), which should not be included as part of the street.

addresses Table:

| Field   | Data Type |
| :------ | :-------- |
| address | text      |

addresses Input:

| address                                 |
| :-------------------------------------- |
| 123 Main St Suite 5A-New York-NY 12345  |
| 456 Park Ave-Minneapolis-MN 34563       |
| 789 Elm St-Goldsboro-NC 23578           |
| 1010 Broadway-Maples-MA 32167           |
| 1111 West St Unit B-Flowertown-FL 94566 |

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT 
  CASE
    WHEN address LIKE '%Suite%' THEN TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(address, 'Suite', 1))
    WHEN address LIKE '%Unit%' THEN TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(address, 'Unit', 1))
    ELSE TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(address, "-", 1))
  END AS street,
  TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(address, "-", 2), "-", -1)) AS city,
  TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(address, "-", 3), "-", -1), " ", 1)) AS state,
  TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(address, "-", 3), "-", -1), " ", -1)) AS postal_code
FROM 
  addresses
```

Output Table:

| street        | city        | state | postal_code |
| :------------ | :---------- | :---- | :---------- |
| 123 Main St   | New York    | NY    | 12345       |
| 456 Park Ave  | Minneapolis | MN    | 34563       |
| 789 Elm St    | Goldsboro   | NC    | 23578       |
| 1010 Broadway | Maples      | MA    | 32167       |
| 1111 West St  | Flowertown  | FL    | 94566       |
