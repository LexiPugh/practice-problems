# My Solution

``` SQL
WITH joined_filtered_data AS (
SELECT 
  status,
  request_at
FROM 
  rides AS r 
  JOIN users AS u1 ON r.client_id = u1.user_id
  JOIN users AS u2 ON r.driver_id = u2.user_id
WHERE
  u1.banned <> 'Yes'
  AND u2.banned <> 'Yes'
  AND r.request_at BETWEEN '2023-12-23' AND '2023-12-25' 
)
SELECT 
  request_at,
  ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN status <> 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(status)) * 100, 2) AS cancellation_rate
FROM 
  joined_filtered_data
GROUP BY
  request_at
```

Output Table:

| request_at | cancellation_rate |
| :--------- | :---------------- |
| 2023-12-23 | 33.33             |
| 2023-12-24 | 0                 |
| 2023-12-25 | 50                |
