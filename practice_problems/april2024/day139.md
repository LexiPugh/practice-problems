## The Question

Suppose you have a table named "Hierarchy" that contains information about the hierarchy of employees in a company. Each row represents a relationship between a supervisor and a subordinate employee, where the "Supervisor_ID" column indicates the ID of the supervisor and the "Employee_ID" column indicates the ID of the subordinate.

The top-level supervisor(s) in the hierarchy won't have anything in the "Supervisor_ID" column. They should be level "1". While each subsequent level will be 1 higher.

Write a query that returns the employee_id and their level (numeric) for each employee. Order on employee_id from lowest to highest.

hierarchy Table:

| Field         | Data Type |
| :------------ | :-------- |
| employee_id   | int       |
| supervisor_id | int       |

hierarchy Input:

| employee_id | supervisor_id |
| :---------- | :------------ |
| 1           | _NULL_        |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 2             |
| 4           | 3             |
| 5           | 3             |
| 6           | 1             |
| 7           | 6             |
| 8           | 7             |
| 9           | 7             |

# My Solution

``` SQL
WITH RECURSIVE employeehierarchy AS (
  SELECT 
    employee_id,
    1 AS level 
  FROM 
    hierarchy
  WHERE
    supervisor_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    h.employee_id,
    eh.level + 1 AS level
  FROM 
    hierarchy AS h INNER JOIN employeehierarchy AS eh 
    ON h.supervisor_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT
  employee_id,
  level
FROM
  employeehierarchy
ORDER BY 
  employee_id
```

Output Table:

| employee_id | level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| 1           | 1     |
| 2           | 2     |
| 3           | 3     |
| 4           | 4     |
| 5           | 4     |
| 6           | 2     |
| 7           | 3     |
| 8           | 4     |
| 9           | 4     |
