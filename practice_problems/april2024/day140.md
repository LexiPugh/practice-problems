## The Question

Inflation sucks.... I mean... cough cough... Inflations has been impacting everyone around the world. Covid hit pretty hard, but let's look at some data before inflation buried us all completely (2020 and before).

We want to look at the average inflation rate change for each country per year and then rank them from highest to lowest.

Calculate the year-over-year inflation rate for each country using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The inflation rate can be calculated as the percentage increase in CPI from one year to the next year.

Rank the countries based on their average inflation rate over the datasetâ€™s time span, with 1 being the highest inflation rate.
