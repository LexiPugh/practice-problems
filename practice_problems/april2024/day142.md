## The Question

Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day.

Write a query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns. Refer to the Example Output below for the desired format.

Definition:

- Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.

measurements Table:

| Column Name       | Type     |
| :---------------- | :------- |
| measurement_id    | integer  |
| measurement_value | decimal  |
| measurement_time  | datetime |

measurements Example Input:

| measurement_id | measurement_value | measurement_time    |
| :------------- | :---------------- | :------------------ |
| 131233         | 1109.51           | 07/10/2022 09:00:00 |
| 135211         | 1662.74           | 07/10/2022 11:00:00 |
| 523542         | 1246.24           | 07/10/2022 13:15:00 |
| 143562         | 1124.50           | 07/11/2022 15:00:00 |
| 346462         | 1234.14           | 07/11/2022 16:45:00 |

Example Output:

| measurement_day     | odd_sum | even_sum |
| :------------------ | :------ | :------- |
| 07/10/2022 00:00:00 | 2355.75 | 1662.74  |
| 07/11/2022 00:00:00 | 1124.50 | 1234.14  |

Explanation:

Based on the results,

- On 07/10/2022, the sum of the odd-numbered measurements is 2355.75, while the sum of the even-numbered measurements is 1662.74.
- On 07/11/2022, there are only two measurements available. The sum of the odd-numbered measurements is 1124.50, and the sum of the even-numbered measurements is 1234.14.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

# My Solution

``` SQL
WITH row_num_table AS (
SELECT 
  measurement_value,
  DATE_TRUNC('day', measurement_time) as measurement_day,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('day', measurement_time) ORDER BY measurement_time ASC) AS row_num
FROM 
  measurements
)
SELECT
  measurement_day,
  SUM(CASE WHEN row_num % 2 = 0 THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS even_sum,
  SUM(CASE WHEN row_num % 2 <> 0 THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS odd_sum
FROM
  row_num_table
GROUP BY
  measurement_day
```

Output Table:

| measurement_day     | even_sum | odd_sum |
| :------------------ | :------- | :------ |
| 07/10/2022 00:00:00 | 1662.74  | 2355.75 |
| 07/11/2022 00:00:00 | 2480.70  | 2377.12 |
| 07/12/2022 00:00:00 | 1244.30  | 2903.40 |
