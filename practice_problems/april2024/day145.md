## The Question

Assume you're given a table on Walmart user transactions. Based on their most recent transaction date, write a query that retrieve the users along with the number of products they bought.

Output the user's most recent transaction date, user ID, and the number of products, sorted in chronological order by the transaction date.

<br>

user_transactions Table:

| Column Name      | Type      |
| :--------------- | :-------- |
| product_id       | integer   |
| user_id          | integer   |
| spend            | decimal   |
| transaction_date | timestamp |

user_transactions Example Input:

| product_id | user_id | spend  | transaction_date    |
| :--------- | :------ | :----- | :------------------ |
| 3673       | 123     | 68.90  | 07/08/2022 12:00:00 |
| 9623       | 123     | 274.10 | 07/08/2022 12:00:00 |
| 1467       | 115     | 19.90  | 07/08/2022 12:00:00 |
| 2513       | 159     | 25.00  | 07/08/2022 12:00:00 |
| 1452       | 159     | 74.50  | 07/10/2022 12:00:00 |

Example Output:

| transaction_date     | user_id | purchase_count |
| :------------------- | :------ | :------------- |
| 07/08/2022 12:00:00  | 115     | 1              |
| 07/08/2022 12:00:000 | 123     | 2              |
| 07/10/2022 12:00:00  | 159     | 1              |


The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

# My Solution

``` SQL
WITH rank_table AS (
  SELECT 
    *,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date DESC) AS rank_num
  FROM 
    user_transactions
)
SELECT 
  transaction_date,
  user_id,
  COUNT(product_id) AS purchase_count
FROM 
  rank_table
WHERE
  rank_num = 1
GROUP BY
  transaction_date,
  user_id
ORDER BY
  transaction_date ASC
```

Output Table:

| transaction_date    | user_id | purchase_count |
| :------------------ | :------ | :------------- |
| 07/11/2022 10:00:00 | 123     | 1              |
| 07/12/2022 10:00:00 | 115     | 1              |
| 07/12/2022 10:00:00 | 159     | 2              |
