## The Question

Assume you're given a table containing data on Amazon customers and their spending on products in different category, write a query to identify the top two highest-grossing products within each category in the year 2022. The output should include the category, product, and total spend.

<br>

product_spend Table:

| Column Name      | Type      |
| :--------------- | :-------- |
| category         | string    |
| product          | string    |
| user_id          | integer   |
| spend            | decimal   |
| transaction_date | timestamp |

product_spend Example Input:

| category    | product          | user_id | spend  | transaction_date    |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :------ | :----- | :------------------ |
| appliance   | refrigerator     | 165     | 246.00 | 12/26/2021 12:00:00 |
| appliance   | refrigerator     | 123     | 299.99 | 03/02/2022 12:00:00 |
| appliance   | washing machine  | 123     | 219.80 | 03/02/2022 12:00:00 |
| electronics | vacuum           | 178     | 152.00 | 04/05/2022 12:00:00 |
| electronics | wireless headset | 156     | 249.90 | 07/08/2022 12:00:00 |
| electronics | vacuum           | 145     | 189.00 | 07/15/2022 12:00:00 |

Example Output:

| category    | product          | total_spend |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :---------- |
| appliance   | refrigerator     | 299.99      |
| appliance   | washing machine  | 219.80      |
| electronics | vacuum           | 341.00      |
| electronics | wireless headset | 249.90      |

Explanation:
Within the "appliance" category, the top two highest-grossing products are "refrigerator" and "washing machine."

In the "electronics" category, the top two highest-grossing products are "vacuum" and "wireless headset."

# My Solution

``` SQL
WITH products_ranked AS (
  SELECT 
    category,
    product,
    SUM(spend) AS total_spend,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY category ORDER BY SUM(spend) DESC) AS rank_num
  FROM 
    product_spend
  WHERE
      DATE_PART('year', transaction_date) = 2022
  GROUP BY
    product,
    category
)
SELECT
  category,
  product,
  total_spend
FROM
  products_ranked
WHERE
  rank_num IN (1, 2)
```

Output Table:

| category    | product          | total_spend |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :---------- |
| appliance   | washing machine  | 439.80      |
| appliance   | refrigerator     | 299.99      |
| electronics | vacuum           | 486.66      |
| electronics | wireless headset | 467.89      |
