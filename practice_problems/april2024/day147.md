## The Question

Assume there are three Spotify tables: artists, songs, and global_song_rank, which contain information about the artists, songs, and music charts, respectively.

Write a query to find the top 5 artists whose songs appear most frequently in the Top 10 of the global_song_rank table. Display the top 5 artist names in ascending order, along with their song appearance ranking.

If two or more artists have the same number of song appearances, they should be assigned the same ranking, and the rank numbers should be continuous (i.e. 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5).

| :-------------- | :-------------------- |
| day             | integer (1-52)        |
| song_id         | integer               |
| rank            | integer (1-1,000,000) |

global_song_rank Example Input:

| day     | song_id     | rank     |

| Ed Sheeran      | 1               |
| Drake           | 2               |

Explanation:
Ed Sheeran's song appeared twice in the Top 10 list of global song rank while Drake's song is only listed once. Therefore, Ed is ranked #1 and Drake is ranked #2.

# My Solution

``` SQL
WITH joined_data AS (
  SELECT 
    artist_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(s.song_id) DESC) AS artist_rank
  FROM 
    artists AS a
    INNER JOIN songs AS s ON a.artist_id = s.artist_id
    INNER JOIN global_song_rank AS gsr ON s.song_id = gsr.song_id
  WHERE
    rank <= 10
  GROUP BY
    artist_name
)
SELECT
  artist_name,
  artist_rank
FROM
  joined_data
WHERE
  artist_rank IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
ORDER BY
  artist_rank ASC
```

Output Table:

| artist_name  | artist_rank |
| :----------- | :---------- |
| Taylor Swift | 1           |
| Bad Bunny    | 2           |
| Drake        | 2           |
| Ed Sheeran   | 3           |
| Adele        | 3           |
