## The Question

Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card. You are asked to estimate how many cards you'll issue in the first month.

Before you can answer this question, you want to first get some perspective on how well new credit card launches typically do in their first month.

Write a query that outputs the name of the credit card, and how many cards were issued in its launch month. The launch month is the earliest record in the monthly_cards_issued table for a given card. Order the results starting from the biggest issued amount.

monthly_cards_issued Table:

| Column Name   | Type    |
| :------------ | :------ |
| issue_month   | integer |
| issue_year    | integer |
| card_name     | string  |
| issued_amount | integer |

monthly_cards_issued Example Input:

| issue_month | issue_year | card_name              | issued_amount |
| :---------- | :--------- | :--------------------- | :------------ |
| 1           | 2021       | Chase Sapphire Reserve | 170000        |
| 2           | 2021       | Chase Sapphire Reserve | 175000        |
| 3           | 2021       | Chase Sapphire Reserve | 180000        |
| 3           | 2021       | Chase Freedom Flex     | 65000         |
| 4           | 2021       | Chase Freedom Flex     | 70000         |

Example Output:

| card_name              | issued_amount |
| :--------------------- | :------------ |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 170000        |
| Chase Freedom Flex     | 65000         |

Explanation:

# My Solution

``` SQL
WITH rank_table AS (
  SELECT
    *,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY card_name ORDER BY issue_year ASC, issue_month ASC) AS rank_num
  FROM
    monthly_cards_issued
)
SELECT
  card_name,
  issued_amount
FROM
  rank_table
WHERE
  rank_num = 1
ORDER BY
  issued_amount DESC
```

Output Table:

| card_name              | issued_amount |
| :--------------------- | :------------ |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 150000        |
| Chase Freedom Flex     | 55000         |
