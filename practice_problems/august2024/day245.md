import pandas as pd

import datetime as dt

employee_turnover['date_left'] = pd.to_datetime(employee_turnover['date_left'])

employee_turnover['year_is_2022'] = employee_turnover['date_left'].dt.year.apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 2022 else None)

employee_turnover_pct = (employee_turnover['year_is_2022'].count() / employee_turnover['date_started'].count()) * 100

print(employee_turnover_pct)
```
