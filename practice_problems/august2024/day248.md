## The Question

Each person is given 200gb of free cloud storage. If they go over they have to pay $1 per gigabyte. Identify each person that went over their free limit and calculate how much they will owe.

Output should have the customer_id and the amount they owe called "fees".

Order fees from largest to smallest.

cloud_storage Table:

| Field        | Data Type |
| :----------- | :-------- |
| customer_id  | int       |
| storage_used | int       |

cloud_storage Input:

| customer_id | storage_used |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| 1001        | 32           |
| 1002        | 289          |
| 1003        | 104          |
| 1004        | 340          |
| 1005        | 150          |
| 1006        | 371          |
| 1007        | 183          |
| 1008        | 211          |
| 1009        | 11           |
| 1010        | 202          |

# My Solution

``` Python
cloud_storage['fees'] = (200 - cloud_storage['storage_used']).abs()

cloud_storage = cloud_storage[cloud_storage['storage_used'] > 200]

cloud_storage[['customer_id', 'fees']].sort_values(by='fees', ascending=False)
```

Output Table:

| customer_id | fees |
| ----------- | ---- |
| 1006        | 171  |
| 1004        | 140  |
| 1002        | 89   |
| 1008        | 11   |
| 1010        | 2    |
