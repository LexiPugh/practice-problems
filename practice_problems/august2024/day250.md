## The Question

Recently there has been low morale at Bad Business Entertainment and people have been quitting.

In an act of desperation they want to find the lowest paid employee in each department of the company and give each of those employees a 15% raise.

Please provide the output of their ID, department, old salary, and new salary to hand off to Accounting. Round new salary to 2 decimal places.

Output should be ordered from highest new salary to lowest new salary.

employee_raise Table:

| Field       | Data Type |
| :---------- | :-------- |
| employee_id | int       |
| department  | text      |
| salary      | int       |

employee_raise Input:

| employee_id | department | salary |
| :---------- | :--------- | :----- |
| 1           | IT         | 50000  |
| 2           | Sales      | 11000  |
| 3           | Accounting | 55000  |

# My Solution

``` Python
employee_raise['row_num'] = employee_raise.sort_values(by='salary', ascending=True).groupby('department').cumcount() + 1

employee_raise = employee_raise[employee_raise['row_num'] == 1]

employee_raise['new_salary'] = (employee_raise['salary'] * 1.15).round(2)

employee_raise[['employee_id', 'department', 'salary', 'new_salary']].sort_values(by='new_salary', ascending=False)
```

Output Table:

| employee_id | department | salary     | new_salary |
| :---------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 1           | IT         | 50000      | 57500      |
| 8           | Accounting | 40000      | 46000      |
| 2           | Sales      | 11000      | 12650      |
