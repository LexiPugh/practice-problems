# My Solution

``` Python
sum_purchases = purchases.groupby('customer_id')['order_total'].sum().reset_index(name='total_spending')

count_orders = purchases.groupby('customer_id')['order_total'].count().reset_index(name='order_count')

purchases = sum_purchases.merge(count_orders, how='outer')

purchases = purchases[(purchases['total_spending'] < 250) | (purchases['order_count'] <= 2)]

purchases[['customer_id']]
```

Output Table:

| customer_id |
| :---------- |
| 1002        |
| 1003        |
| 1005        |
