## The Question

A construction company gave each employee a $100 per diem for food for the week. If they spend over that amount they owe the company that money back.

Calculate how much each person spent and how much they owe the company. If they spent less than $100 they owe $0.

Provide the employee_id, amount spent, and amount owed (labeled "amount_owed") in the output.

Order by the amount owed from highest to lowest. Order by employee id if there are multiple people who owe the same amount.

# My Solution

``` Python
crew_spending = crew_spending.groupby('employee_id')['amount_spent'].sum().reset_index(name='total_amount_spent')

crew_spending['amount_owed'] = crew_spending['total_amount_spent'].apply(lambda x: x-100 if x > 100 else 0)

crew_spending = crew_spending.sort_values(by=['amount_owed', 'employee_id'], ascending=[False, True])

crew_spending[['employee_id', 'total_amount_spent', 'amount_owed']]
```

Output Table:

| employee_id | total_amount_spent | amount_owed |
| :---------- | :----------------- | :---------- |
