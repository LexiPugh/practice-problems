## The Question

If you're looking for a tall handsome man this question is for you. If not... well it's a good learning opportunity. Let's figure out which countries have an above average height!

Write a query to find the countries where their average height is above the global average.

The output should have the columns Country and Average_Height, and should be ordered by Average_Height in descending order.
