# My Solution

``` Python
import pandas as pd

import datetime 

profits['date'] = pd.to_datetime(profits['date'])

profits['month'] = profits['date'].dt.month

profits = profits.groupby('month')['profit'].sum().reset_index(name='total_profit')

profits = profits[(profits['month'] <= 6) & (profits['total_profit'] > 0)].sort_values(by='total_profit', ascending=False)
```

Output Table:

| month | total_profit |
| :---- | :----------- |
| 4     | 1908         |
| 6     | 416          |
