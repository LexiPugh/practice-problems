# My Solution

``` Python
import pandas as pd

products2022 = products[products['year'] == 2022].groupby('company_name').size().reset_index(name='count_2022')

products2023 = products[products['year'] == 2023].groupby('company_name').size().reset_index(name='count_2023')

combined_df = pd.merge(products2022, products2023, how='outer')

combined_df = combined_df.fillna(0)

combined_df['difference'] = combined_df['count_2023'] - combined_df['count_2022']

combined_df[['company_name', 'difference']].sort_values(by='company_name', ascending=True)
```

Output Table:

| company_name | difference |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Apple        | -1         |
| Google       | 0          |
| Huawei       | 1          |
| Oppo         | 1          |
| Samsung      | -2         |
| Sony         | 1          |
| Xiaomi       | 0          |
