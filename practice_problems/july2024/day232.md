# My Solution

``` Python
combined_df = customers.merge(date_viewed, how='inner')

combined_df = combined_df.groupby('name')['movie_id'].count().reset_index()

combined_df = combined_df.sort_values(by='movie_id', ascending=False)

combined_df[['name']].head(1)
```

Output Table:

| name |
| :--- |
| Tom  |
