# My Solution

``` Python
tech_layoffs['pct_employees_fired'] = ((tech_layoffs['employees_fired'] / tech_layoffs['company_size']) * 100).round(2)

tech_layoffs = tech_layoffs.sort_values(by='company', ascending=True)

tech_layoffs[['company', 'pct_employees_fired']]
```

Output Table:

| company   | pct_employees_fired |
| :-------- | :------------------ |
| Amazon    | 0.92                |
| Apple     | 0                   |
