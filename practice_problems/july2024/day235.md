## The Question

Write a query to find the average concentration of each pollutant type across all locations in the table.

Filter down to those with a concentration greater than 0.5 on average.

Provide the pollutant and the average concentration in the output.

Order by pollutant alphabetically.

Round concentration to 2 decimal places.

pollution Table:

| Field         | Data Type |
| :------------ | :-------- |
| id            | int       |
| location      | text      |
| pollutant     | text      |
| concentration | float     |
| date          | text      |

pollution Input:

| id | location | pollutant  | concentration | date       |
| :- | :------- | :--------- | :------------ | :--------- |
| 1  | River    | Mercury    | 0.23          | 2022-01-01 |
| 2  | Lake     | Lead       | 0.18          | 2022-01-02 |
| 3  | Ocean    | Nitrogen   | 2.04          | 2022-01-03 |
| 4  | River    | Phosphorus | 1.12          | 2022-01-04 |
| 5  | Pond     | Arsenic    | 0.09          | 2022-01-05 |
| 6  | River    | Lead       | 0.29          | 2022-01-06 |
| 7  | Lake     | Mercury    | 0.19          | 2022-01-07 |
| 8  | Ocean    | Nitrogen   | 1.92          | 2022-01-08 |
| 9  | River    | Phosphorus | 0.98          | 2022-01-09 |
| 10 | Pond     | Arsenic    | 0.06          | 2022-01-10 |

# My Solution

``` Python
pollution = pollution.groupby('pollutant')['concentration'].mean().round(2).reset_index()

pollution = pollution[pollution['concentration'] > 0.5]

pollution = pollution.sort_values(by='pollutant', ascending=True)

pollution
```

Output Table:

| pollutant  | avg_concentration |
| :--------- | :---------------- |
| Nitrogen   | 1.98              |
| Phosphorus | 1.05              |
