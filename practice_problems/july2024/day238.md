## The Question

Often when you're working with customer information you'll want to sell that data to a third party. Sometimes it is illegal to give away sensitive information such as a full name.

Here you are given a table that contains a customer ID and their full name.

Return the customer ID with only the first name of each customer.

<br>

customers Table:

| Field       | Data Type |
| :---------- | :-------- |
| customer_id | int       |
| full_name   | text      |

customers Input:

| customer_id | full_name     |
| :---------- | :------------ |
| 1001        | John McGary   |
| 1002        | Sally Sue     |
| 1003        | Jenny McBlue  |
| 1004        | Craig Johnson |
| 1005        | Henry Hue     |
| 1006        | Alex Freebird |

<br>

# My Solution

``` Python
customers['first_name'] = customers['full_name'].str.split(" ").str[0]

customers[['customer_id', 'first_name']]
```

Output Table:

| customer_id | first_name |
| :---------- | :--------- |
| 1001        | John       |
| 1002        | Sally      |
| 1003        | Jenny      |
| 1004        | Craig      |
| 1005        | Henry      |
| 1006        | Alex       |
