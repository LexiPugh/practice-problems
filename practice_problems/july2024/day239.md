## The Question

Antoni's Pizza Shop makes hundreds of pizzas per day. One of the most popular toppings is pepperoni.

The price of pepperoni has skyrocketed, but he doesn't want to raise his prices.

Currently the price for pepperoni is around $.50 cents per ounce.

Antoni uses 2 ounce of pepperonis for an average pizza.

Calculate how much money he would save if he used 1.5oz of pepperoni per pizza for his daily pepperoni pizzas.

# My Solution

``` Python
orders = orders[orders['pizza_order'] == 'Pepperoni']

savings = (orders['pizza_order'].count()) * (0.5 * 0.5)

print(savings)
```

Output:

12.25
