bad_data Table:

| Field | Data Type |
| :---- | :-------- |
| id    | text      |

bad_data Input:

| id           |
| :----------- |

# My Solution

``` Python
bad_data['first_name'] = bad_data['id'].str[5:]

bad_data['id'] = bad_data['id'].str[:5]

bad_data[['id', 'first_name']]
```

Output Table:

| fixed_id | fixed_name |
| :------- | :--------- |
| 12345    | Johnny     |
| 93829    | Sally      |
