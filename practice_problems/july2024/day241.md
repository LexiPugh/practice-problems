grades Table:

| Field        | Data Type |
| :----------- | :-------- |
| student_name | text      |
| grade        | int       |

grades Input:

# My Solution

``` Python
grades['ranks'] = grades['grade'].rank(method='dense', ascending=False)

grades = grades.sort_values(by=['ranks', 'student_name'], ascending=[True, True])

grades
```

Output Table:

| student_name | grade | ranks |
| :----------- | :---- | :---- |
| Dwight       | 98    | 1     |
| Jim          | 98    | 1     |
