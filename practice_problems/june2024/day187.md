## The Question

Mr. Hillsborough gives out letters of recommendation for any student who can obtain a "B" or higher in his class.

Write a query to retrieve the first and last name of the students who scored a "B" or better on their final exam.

Order your output by the first and last name in ascending order. This is just how Mr. Hillsborough prefers it.
