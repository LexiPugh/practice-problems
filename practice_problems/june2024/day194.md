## The Question

It's been a tough year and the CEO has tasked you to trim the low performers so they can save face with the stakeholders. It's just good business.

A low performer is someone who was given a rating of 5 or less in their end of year review and has completed less than 75% of the tasks assigned to them.

Return the names of the low performers in the output (and hope your name isn't on the list).

Order output alphabetically.

# My Solution

``` Python
employee_info = employee_info[(employee_info['end_of_year_review_rating'] <= 5) & ((employee_info['tasks_completed']/employee_info['tasks_assigned']) < 0.75)]

employee_info = employee_info.sort_values(by='name', ascending=True)

employee_info[['name']]
```

Output Table:

| name         |
| :----------- |
| Bailey Banks |
| Nolan Nunez  |
