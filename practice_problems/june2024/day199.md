# My Solution

``` SQL
WITH calculator_sales AS
(
  SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN year = 2000 THEN calculator_sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales2000,
    SUM(CASE WHEN year = 2023 THEN calculator_sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales2023
  FROM 
    calculators
)
SELECT
  ROUND(((sales2023 - sales2000) / sales2000) * 100, 2) AS pct_change
FROM
  calculator_sales
```
