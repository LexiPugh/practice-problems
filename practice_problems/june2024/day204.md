# My Solution

``` Python
big_pharma['money_lost'] = (big_pharma['money_made'] - big_pharma['money_spent']).abs().round(1)

big_pharma = big_pharma[(big_pharma['money_made'] - big_pharma['money_spent']) < 0]

big_pharma = big_pharma.sort_values(by='money_lost', ascending=False)

big_pharma.head(3)
```
