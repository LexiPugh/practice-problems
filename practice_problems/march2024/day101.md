## The Question

The addresses in this table are in a very strange format. We actually need them broken out into street address, city, state, and zip code, but currently it's pretty unusable.

Write a query to break out this column into street, city, state, and zip_code with those names exactly.

<br>

addresses Table:

| Field   | Data Type |
| :------ | :-------- |
| address | text      |

addresses Input:

| address                              |
| :----------------------------------- |
| 123 Main St- Anytown- CA- 12345      |
| 456 Elm St- Springfield- IL- 67890   |
| 789 Oak Ave- Newtown- PA- 23456      |
| 1010 Maple Dr- Greensboro- NC- 34567 |
| 1313 Pine St- Seattle- WA- 45678     |

<br>

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT 
  TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(address, '-', 1)) AS street,
  TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(address, '-', 2), '-', -1)) AS city,
  TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(address, '-', 3), '-', -1)) AS state,
  TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(address, '-', -1)) AS zip_code
FROM addresses
```

Output Table:

| street        | city        | state | zip_code |
| :------------ | :---------- | :---- | :------- |
| 123 Main St   | Anytown     | CA    | 12345    |
| 456 Elm St    | Springfield | IL    | 67890    |
| 789 Oak Ave   | Newtown     | PA    | 23456    |
| 1010 Maple Dr | Greensboro  | NC    | 34567    |
| 1313 Pine St  | Seattle     | WA    | 45678    |
