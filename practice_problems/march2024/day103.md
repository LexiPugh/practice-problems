## The Question

Each artist was given a rating by 3 separate judges.

Write a query to combine those scores and rank the artists from highest to lowest. If there is a tie the next ranking after it should be the next number sequentially, meaning there will be a gap in the next rank.

Output should include the artist, their total score, and rank.

Order your output from smallest to largest rank. If there is a tie order on the artist id as well from smallest to largest.

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT
  artist_id,
  SUM(score) AS total_score,
  RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(score) DESC) AS rank_num
FROM 
  rankings
GROUP BY
  artist_id
ORDER BY
  rank_num,
  artist_id
```

Output Table:

| artist_id | total_score | rank_num |
| :-------- | :---------- | :------- |
| 4         | 23          | 1        |
| 5         | 23          | 1        |
| 2         | 17          | 3        |
| 1         | 15          | 4        |
| 3         | 15          | 4        |
