## The Question

At Kelly's Ice Cream Shop, Kelly gives a 33% discount on each customer's 3rd purchase.

Write a query to select the 3rd transaction for each customer that received that discount. Output the customer id, transaction id, amount, and the amount after the discount as "discounted_amount".

Order output on customer ID in ascending order.

Note: Transaction IDs occur sequentially. The lowest transaction ID is the earliest ID.

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT
  customer_id,
  transaction_id,
  amount,
  (amount * 0.67) AS discounted_amount
FROM (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    transaction_id,
    amount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_id ASC) AS row_num
  FROM 
    purchases
  ) AS temp_table
WHERE
  row_num = 3
ORDER BY
  customer_id ASC
```

Output Table:

| customer_id | transaction_id | amount | discounted_amount |
| :---------- | :------------- | :----- | :---------------- |
