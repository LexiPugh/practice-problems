## The Question

If a dog owner takes their dogs on fewer than 5 walks in a week label them as a "Bad Owner". Everyone else should be labeled "Good Owner".

The column should be called "owner_type".

Note: If the owner has more than one dog, they have to walk each dog at least 5 times to be a "Good Owner."

Provide the name and type of owner in the output. Order alphabetically.

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT 
  owner_name,
  CASE 
    WHEN MIN(all_walks) < 5 THEN 'Bad Owner'
    ELSE 'Good Owner'
  END AS owner_type
FROM (
  SELECT
    owner_name,
    dog_name,
    SUM(times_walked) AS all_walks
  FROM
    walks
  GROUP BY
    owner_name,
    dog_name
) AS temp_table
GROUP BY
  owner_name
ORDER BY
  owner_name ASC
```

Output Table:

| owner_name | owner_type |
| :--------- | :--------- |
| Jimmy      | Good Owner |
| Kelly      | Good Owner |
| Peter      | Bad Owner  |
