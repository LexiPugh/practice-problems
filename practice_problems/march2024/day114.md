## The Question

In a fictious world, individuals get taxed depending on how much their company pays their employees. The higher the total salary their companies pay, the less they are taxed.

It's unfair, but that's life.

Write a query to find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes. Round the salary to the nearest integer.

The tax rate is calculated for each individual based on the following criteria:

10% tax if the Sum of all salaries of a company is over 200k.

25% tax if the Sum of all salaries of a company is between 100k -199k

40% tax if the Sum of all salaries of a company is 99k or below.

Include the company id, employee id, department, and the "taxed_salary".

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT
  company_id,
  employee_id,
  department,
  CASE
    WHEN total_salary > 200000 THEN (salary * 0.9)
    WHEN total_salary <= 99000 THEN (salary * 0.6)
    ELSE (salary * 0.75) 
  END AS taxed_salary
FROM (
  SELECT 
    company_id,
    employee_id,
    department,
    salary,
    SUM(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY company_id) AS total_salary
  FROM
    taxes) AS temp_table
```

Output Table:

| company_id | employee_id | department | taxed_salary |
