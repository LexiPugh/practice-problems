## The Question

Banks have the ability to approve or deny transactions made depending on several factors.

The bank wants you to come in and create a report for them that gives them the following information:

Month, Country, Approved_Transactions, Approved_Amount, Chargebacks, Chargeback_Amount.

They want to look at historic trends for months, not years. They want all of one months data on one line. For example, all of January's data for the above columns should be output on one row.

A chargeback is the amount sent back to a bank account if a transaction is declined.

Return the output table order based off earliest month.

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT 
  MONTH(transaction_date) AS month,
  country AS country,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'Approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_transactions,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'Approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_amount,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'Declined' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS chargebacks,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'Declined' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS chargeback_amount
FROM 
  transactions
GROUP BY
  month,
  Country
ORDER BY
  month ASC
```
