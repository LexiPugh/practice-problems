## The Question

Our IT Department wants to run some analytics to take a closer look at how well they're doing responding to help requests.

Write a query to find how many requests have been completed for each type of request.

Also provide the percentage of requests that are completed vs in-progress/ received to show the percent complete of requests for each type.

Provide the type, count of completed requests, count of incomplete requests, and the percentage of completed requests per type in the output.

| type       | int       |
| state      | text      |

help_requests Input:

| request_id | type | state       |
| :--------- | :--- | :---------- |
| 1          | 1    | Received    |

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT 
  type,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS completed_requests,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state <> 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS incomplete_requests,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / (SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + SUM(CASE WHEN state <> 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) * 100 AS pct_complete
FROM 
  help_requests
GROUP BY
  type
```

Output Table:

| type | completed_requests | incomplete_requests | pct_complete |
| :--- | :----------------- | :------------------ | :----------- |
| 1    | 5                  | 8                   | 38.4615      |
| 2    | 4                  | 2                   | 66.6667      |
