``` SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(sale_amount) DESC) AS rank_num
  FROM 
    customer_transactions
  GROUP BY
    customer_id
  ORDER BY
    rank_num,
    customer_id) AS temp_table
WHERE
  rank_num IN (1, 2, 3)
```

Output Table:

| customer_id | total_sales | rank_num |
| :---------- | :---------- | :------- |
| 102         | 400         | 1        |
| 103         | 325         | 2        |
| 101         | 300         | 3        |
