``` SQL
SELECT
  product_id,
  CONCAT(UCASE(LEFT(fixed_product_name, 1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(fixed_product_name, 2))) AS product_name,
  amount_sold
FROM (
  SELECT 
    product_id,
    REGEXP_REPLACE(product_name, '[^0-9a-zA-Z ]', '') AS fixed_product_name,
    amount_sold
  FROM 
    janines_mistakes ) AS temp_table
```
