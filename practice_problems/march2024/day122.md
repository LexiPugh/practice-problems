## The Question

Maggie's Restaurant has been having a problem with people returning their food. They have a feeling one or many of their chefs are making mistakes.

They need to find out which chef is causing the returns so they train them better.

Write a query to find the chef(s) that is causing the most returned food. Include the chef name and the amount of returned orders in the output.

Only include the chef with the most returns in your output.

Note: If there is a tie for most returns output them both in alphabetical order

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT
  chef_name,
  returned_orders
FROM (
  SELECT 
    chef_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_returned = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS returned_orders,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(CASE WHEN order_returned = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) DESC) AS rank_num
  FROM 
    orders
  GROUP BY
    chef_name ) AS temp_table
WHERE 
  rank_num = 1
ORDER BY
  chef_name ASC
```

Output Table:

| chef_name       | returned_orders |
| :-------------- | :-------------- |
| Charles McBakey | 3               |
| John McFry      | 3               |
