## The Question

As a data analyst on the Oracle Sales Operations team, you are given a list of salespeopleâ€™s deals, and the annual quota they need to hit.

Write a query that outputs each employee id and whether they hit the quota or not ('yes' or 'no'). Order the results by employee id in ascending order.

Definitions:

- deal_size: Deals acquired by a salesperson in the year. Each salesperson may have more than 1 deal.
- quota: Total annual quota for each salesperson.

<br>

deals Table:

| Column Name     |   Type   |
| :-------------- | :------- |
| employee_id     | integer  |
| deal_size       | integer  |

deals Example Input:

| employee_id | deal_size |
| :---------- | :-------- |
| 101         | 400000    |
| 101         | 300000    |
| 201         | 500000    |
| 301         | 500000    |

sales_quotas Table:

| Column Name     | Type     |
| :-------------- | :------- |
| employee_id     | integer  |
| quota           | integer  |

sales_quotas Example Input:

| employee_id | quota  |
| :---------- | :----- |
| 101         | 500000 |
| 201         | 400000 |
| 301         | 600000 |

Example Output:

| employee_id | made_quota |
| :---------- | :--------- |
| 101         | yes        |
| 201         | yes        |
| 301         | no         |

Explanation:
User 101 had $700k in sales, beating their $500k quota. User 201 had $500k in sales, beating their $400k quota. User 301 had $500k in sales, but had a $600k quota, so they didn't hit their goal.

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT
  d.employee_id,
  CASE
    WHEN SUM(d.deal_size) > s.quota THEN 'yes'
    ELSE 'no'
  END AS made_quota
FROM 
  deals AS d INNER JOIN sales_quotas AS s 
  ON d.employee_id = s.employee_id
GROUP BY
  d.employee_id,
  s.quota
ORDER BY
  d.employee_id
```

Output Table:

| employee_id | made_quota |
| :---------- | :--------- |
| 1           | yes        |
| 101         | yes        |
| 201         | yes        |
| 301         | no         |
| 405         | no         |
