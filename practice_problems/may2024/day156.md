# My Solution

``` Python
shopping_cart['percentage'] = ((shopping_cart['purchased_items'] / shopping_cart['carted_items']) * 100).round(2)

shopping_cart = shopping_cart.sort_values(by='customer_id', ascending=False)

shopping_cart[['customer_id', 'percentage']]
```

Output Table:
| customer_id    | percentage   |                                               
| :------------  | :----------  |                                                      
| 1001	         | 100          |   
| 1002	         | 90.91        |             
| 1003	         | 100          |
| 1004	         | 81.67        |  
| 1005	         | 0            |
| 1006	         | 100          |
