# My Solution

``` Python
max_order = orders['number_of_orders'].max()

orders = orders[(orders.number_of_orders == max_order)]

orders
```

Output Table:
| customer_id    | number_of_orders  |                                               
| :------------  | :----------       |                                                      
| 2   	         | 25                |   
| 7   	         | 25                |
