first_three_letters = gamer_tags['first_name'].str[:3]

year_of_birth = gamer_tags['birth_date'].str.split('/').str[2]

gamer_tags['gamer_tag'] = first_three_letters + year_of_birth

gamer_tags = gamer_tags.sort_values(by='gamer_tag')

gamer_tags[['first_name', 'last_name', 'gamer_tag']]
```
