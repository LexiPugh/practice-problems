| date_played | date      |
| game        | text      |

devices Input:

| device_id | date_played | game              |
| --------- | ----------- | :---------------- |

# My Solution

``` Python
devices = devices[devices['game'] == 'League of Legends']

devices = devices.groupby('device_id').min().reset_index()

devices = devices.sort_values(by='date_played', ascending=False)

devices[['device_id', 'date_played']]
```

Output Table:

| device_id | date_played |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1         | 2019-02-16  |
| 3         | 2022-10-02  |
