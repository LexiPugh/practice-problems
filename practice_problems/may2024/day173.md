# My Solution

``` Python
restaurant_reviews['comment_count'] = restaurant_reviews.groupby('restaurant')['comment'].transform('count')

restaurant_reviews['avg_rating'] = restaurant_reviews.groupby('restaurant')['rating'].transform('mean')

restaurant_reviews = restaurant_reviews.sort_values(by=['comment_count', 'avg_rating'], ascending=[False, False])

restaurant_reviews[['restaurant', 'comment_count', 'avg_rating']].head(1)
```

Output Table:

| restaurant       | comment_count | avg_rating |
| :--------------- | :------------ | :--------- |
| Jimmy's Barbecue | 2             | 4.6        |
