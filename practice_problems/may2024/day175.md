# My Solution

``` Python
inspections = inspections[inspections['minor_issues'] <= 3]

inspections = inspections[inspections['critical_issues'] < 1]

inspections = inspections.sort_values(by='owner_name')

inspections[['owner_name', 'vehicle']]
```

Output Table:

| owner_name | vehicle                |
| :--------- | :--------------------- |
| David      | 1998 Ford F-150        |
| Hannah     | 2018 Honda Accord      |
| Jim        | 2012 Ford Fusion       |
| Joseph     | 2015 Toyota Highlander |
| Mikaela    | 2021 Dodge Stratus     |
| Sally      | 2023 Tesla Model S     |
