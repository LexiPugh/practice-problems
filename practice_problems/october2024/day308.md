## The Question

The telephone numbers in the database are very inconsistently formatted. You'd like to print a list of member ids and numbers that have had '-','(',')', and ' ' characters removed. Order by member id.

<br>

Schema:

![The image shows a database schema for a club management system consisting of three tables: cd.members, cd.bookings, and cd.facilities. cd.members: Contains member details with columns for memid (integer), surname (character varying(200)), firstname (character varying(200)), address (character varying(300)), zipcode (integer), telephone (character varying(20)), recommendedby (integer), and joindate (timestamp). cd.bookings: Stores booking information with columns for facid (integer), memid (integer), starttime (timestamp), and slots (integer). cd.facilities: Holds facility data with columns for facid (integer), name (character varying(100)), membercost (numeric), guestcost (numeric), initialoutlay (numeric), and monthlymaintenance (numeric). Relationships: The cd.bookings table connects cd.members and cd.facilities using memid and facid as foreign keys.](https://github.com/LexiPugh/practice-problems/blob/main/figs/pg_schema.png)

# My Solution

``` SQL
SELECT
	memid,
	REGEXP_REPLACE(telephone, '[-() ]', '', 'g') AS telephone
FROM
	cd.members
ORDER BY
	memid
```
